**COVID-19 Mortality Analysis Based on Age and Health Conditions**

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing factors contributing to COVID-19 mortality across different age groups and health conditions in the United States. Using a large dataset from Data.gov, this analysis explores the relationships between age, preexisting health conditions, and COVID-19-related deaths, applying various data science techniques, including clustering and predictive modeling.

**Objectives**
Identify trends: Investigate states with the highest COVID-19 mortality rates and identify trends over time.
Analyze clusters: Group individuals based on age and underlying health conditions to observe patterns in mortality rates.
Predictive modeling: Develop models to predict COVID-19 deaths using age groups and health conditions.

**Key Techniques**
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data distributions, trends, and relationships through histograms and temporal line plots.
Clustering: Used K-Means clustering to group data by age and comorbidities to understand the risk factors contributing to mortality.
Predictive Modeling: Implemented linear regression, decision tree regression, and gradient boosting algorithms to predict COVID-19 mortality rates.

**Findings**
Age Group Impact: Older populations (aged 65+) were significantly more likely to succumb to COVID-19 compared to younger age groups.
Health Conditions: Comorbidities such as respiratory diseases, Alzheimer's, and heart-related issues were the strongest predictors of COVID-19 fatalities.
Trends: The peak of COVID-19 deaths was in 2021, followed by a significant decline in 2022, indicating the effectiveness of vaccines and preventive measures.

**Tools and Technologies**
Data Preprocessing: Pandas, Seaborn, NumPy
Clustering: K-Means Algorithm
Predictive Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Dataset: COVID-19 Mortality Data from Data.gov

**Conclusion**
This study emphasizes the importance of age and underlying health conditions in predicting COVID-19 mortality. By applying advanced data science techniques, we provide insights that could help public health officials tailor their strategies to mitigate the impact of future pandemics.

**Future Work**
Enhance the predictive model's accuracy by incorporating additional features and more advanced machine learning models.
Extend the analysis to study the impact of new variants and vaccination rates.
